# Analysing 180 Days of My Habit Tracker Data
This project is an attempt to discover my drivers of well-being while exploring the potential of data in decision-making, The project highlights how even small, seemingly behaviors (like meditation or sugar consumption) can have measurable psychological effects.


## Project Overview: 
- In this project, I have applied **exploratory data analysis, trend tracking, and correlation modeling** to a 180-day personal habit tracker to uncover the behavioral patterns that most influence my well-being.
- The goal was to identify habitual drivers of mood, measure consistency trends, and build data-backed self-awareness using Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib) — replicating how a business might analyze consumer behavior, only here, the consumer is myself.

2. Understanding the Key Drivers of Emotional Health - Mindfulness habits show the strongest link to mood, while other behaviors act as supporting factors

## Data Source: 
- I tracked my habits across multiple parameters like meditation, journallinng, sugar intake, no. of sleeping hours, and overall mood in Google Sheets for 180 days.
- The same was cleaned for the purpose of the analysis (for eg: Yes/ No in my tracker was replaced with 1/0's)


## My Learnings and Takeaways from this project:
- Consistency across multiple habits drives momentum –  so **smaller steps in multiple keystone habits is better than focusing on only one habit in isolation**.
- Considering that mood as an outcome may not always respond instantly, **rolling averages provide a helpful directional insight**. This also indicates that analyzing correlation that incorporates some lag in the model could be more helpful.
- **Correlation doesn’t imply causation**(for example: sugar-free days being weakly associated with low mood doesn’t imply that consuming sugar has no impact on mood at all).

**How can this be applied to a business context:**
- **Over-indexing on one specific user behaviour to predict the outcome may not give useful insights**.  It’s very important to track quantifiable loyalty behaviors (repeat purchase, interaction with new campaigns) instead of just revenue brought in by a consumer.
- A user may not show immediate satisfaction or loyalty after signing up or trying a product once. But **repeated exposure or use can create stickiness**.
